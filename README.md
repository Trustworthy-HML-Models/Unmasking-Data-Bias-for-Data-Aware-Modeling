# Unmasking-Data-Bias-for-Data-Aware-Modeling

This repository provides the official data analysis codes of the 'Datasheet for MIMIC IV v2.0 CRD' of the paper "Re-evaluating Fairness in Real-World Healthcare
Machine Learning: Data-Centric Approach through MIMIC IV Analysis"

The paper analyzes prevalent HML prediction models using the MIMIC dataset across all demographics. Access to the MIMIC IV v2.0 data  is restricted to PhysioNet credentialed users only and the entire process is listed in Whose Health Matters in Healthcare Models? Unmasking Data Bias for Data-Aware Modeling. 

Once PhysioNet has reviewed the personal details, CITI training completion, and DUA agreement, they will grant access to the MIMIC IV database. You can retrieve all the necessary files from the files section of the MIMIC IV v2.0 available at https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/2.2/ 

For our analysis, we retrieved datasets for various prediction tasks, including in-hospital mortality, heart failure, chronic kidney disease (CKD), 30-day readmission, and length of stay (LOS) for heart failure. Entire details of data retrieval is listed in Whose Health Matters in Healthcare Models? Unmasking Data Bias for Data-Aware Modeling.

Python 3 software was used for the analysis, leveraging its analytical and statistical libraries. The complete code for analyzing the length of ICU stay for heart failure patients over 7 days is available in Prediction-task-codes repository.
